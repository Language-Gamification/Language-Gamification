All submissions must be in PDF format, and in a single PDF file include, in this order:
1. The submitted paper
2. Technical appendices

The main text of a submitted paper is limited to <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;"> FOUR content pages </span>, including all figures and tables. Additional pages containing references donâ€™t count as content pages.

The main text and references may be followed by technical appendices, for which there is no page limit.

All submission must follow the NeurIPS-2024 styles, and the corresponding style files can be downloaded as [Zip](/assets/files/Styles.zip), or accessed via [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/neurips-2024/tpsbbrdqcmsh).

<!---->
<!-- * __Modeling:__ algorithms and pipelines for learning from instructions and human feedback; designing training objectives and rewards; training and inference efficiency -->
<!-- * __Data Collection:__ crowd-sourcing; synthetic data generation; data democratization -->
<!-- * __Evaluation and Oversight__: effective and reliable oversight over existing models; enforcing guardrails and guarantees for model behaviors; interpretability and analysis -->
<!-- * __Engineering and Open-sourcing:__ best practice in training, evaluation and deployment; open-sourcing efforts; openness and reproducibility -->
<!-- * __Applications:__ long-context, multi-round and personalized instruction-following models -->
<!-- * __Multimodal and Multidisciplinary:__ instruction following models for computer vision, robotics, games, art, etc. -->
<!-- * __Limitations, Risks and Safety:__ bias and fairness; factuality and hallucination; safety concerns arising from instruction-following models -->
<!-- * Other adjacent research topics (e.g., in-context learning, prompting, multi-task learning) that enable better responses to instructions in dynamic environments -->

<!-- ### Guidelines -->
<!---->
<!-- * Paper submission is hosted on [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2023/Workshop/Instruction). -->
<!-- * We welcome papers __up to 9 pages (max)__, not including references or appendix.  -->
<!--   * Please use the provided LaTex template ([zip](/assets/template/instruction_workshop_template.zip), [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/instruction-workshop-at-neurips-2023-template/fqkhtqxvjrrq)) for your submission. -->
<!--   * The paper should be anonymized and uploaded to OpenReview as a single PDF.  -->
<!--   * You may use as many pages of references and appendix as you wish, but reviewers are not required to read the appendix.  -->
<!--   * We welcome 4-page extended abstract submissions. -->
<!-- * This is a __non-archival__ workshop. No submission will be indexed nor have archival proceedings. -->
<!--   * Accepted papers will appear on the workshop website.  -->
<!--   * They will also be available on OpenReview and NeurIPS virtual site. -->
<!--   * We accept submissions that are under review at other venues (e.g., ICLR 2024), as long as this does not violate the dual-submission / anonymity policy of the other venue. -->
<!-- * The review process will be double-blind. -->
<!-- * We will announce the best paper award at the workshop! -->
